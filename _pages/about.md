Welcome! I’m **Kenny (Qihang) Xu**, an AI Engineer with a background in mechanical engineering, machine learning, and intelligent systems. I specialize in natural language processing, large language models (LLMs), and transformer-based architectures, particularly in safety-critical applications such as microgrid control, predictive maintenance, and scientific simulations.

My professional journey includes research and development roles across academia, startups, and government-funded projects (NASA, DOE, DOT), where I built end-to-end machine learning systems — from transformer-based forecasting pipelines to real-time anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems.

I hold a **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering** from **Arizona State University**, where I focused on physics-informed machine learning. I’m currently working at **WindQuiet Technology, Inc.** in Mountain View, California, developing AI-powered tools for renewable energy optimization.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about building open-source AI tools and sharing knowledge through publications and collaborative projects. You can view my [CV here](/files/Kenny_Xu_0625.pdf) or connect via [GitHub](https://github.com/KennyXu17) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kennyxu17).
